ExcelFrogger
============

A version of the arcade game Frogger, in Excel 2000/2003

Written mainly as a joke, this Excel worksheet lets you play a game of the old Arcade game frogger in Excel.

It has only every been tested on Excel 2000/2003 but may work on later versions.

It works by sizing down the cells of a worksheet into a (roughly) 2x2 pixel size and then changing their back colours to simulate a frame buffer.
