ExcelFrogger
============

A version of the arcade game Frogger, in Excel 2000/2003

Written mainly as a joke, this Excel worksheet lets you play a game of the old Arcade game frogger in Excel.

It has been tested on 32-bit Excels and recently updated to allow working on x64 Excel.

It works by sizing down the cells of a worksheet into a (roughly) 2x2 pixel size and then changing their back colours to simulate a frame buffer.

** Generally only performs well when saved to a local, physical disk **

Controls
--------

On loading you may get messages to enable/trust various things.  Obviously that decision is up to you but you're free to explore the code before running it.

Press the obvious big button to start the game.  Once in the game make sure input focus is somewhere on the spreadsheet and then use arrow keys to steer the frog to his homes.  

If the boss wanders round then press the `End` key to go back to the normal spreadsheet and look like you're working.
